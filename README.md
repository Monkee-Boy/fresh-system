# So Fresh. So Clean.

Getting your local dev environment up and running on a fresh install. Although this is designed to install and configure items automatically - you are able to run each task in `./installers` individually if you would prefer.

## Usage

* Download the latest version of [master](https://github.com/Monkee-Boy/fresh-system/archive/master.zip).
* Take a look at `./configs` and customize to fit your needs. Ex: by default it installs VS Code, if you prefer another code editor - edit the `Brewfile`, comment out VS Code and uncomment Sublime or Atom.
* Run `cd fresh-system && sh setup.sh`.
